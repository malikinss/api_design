## What is a Cookie in HTTP?

A **cookie** is a small piece of data sent by a server to a client and stored on the client’s device. Cookies are used to:

-   Track sessions
-   Store preferences or tokens
-   Enhance security
-   Improve user experience

**API cookies** are specifically used for **API authentication and session management**, simplifying repeated authentication requests.

---

## Features of API Cookies

-   Randomly generated by the server
-   Short expiration times, often session-based
-   Used primarily for authentication
-   Simplifies repeated API calls without sending credentials every time

---

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

-   Simplifies authentication process
-   Avoids repeated credential entry
-   Easy session management

### Disadvantages

-   Security risks if stolen (session hijacking)
-   Possible sudden expiration
-   Server-side management burden

> ⚠️ Use HTTPS and secure server-side management for safety.

## API Cookies vs. HTTP Cookies

| Feature    | API Cookie               | HTTP Cookie                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Purpose    | API authentication       | User identification on websites |
| Issuer     | API server               | Web server                      |
| Expiration | Session-based            | Can be long-term                |
| Security   | Often uses secret tokens | Often plaintext                 |
| Management | Server-side              | Client + server                 |

**Common traits:** Both are stored on the client, sent in HTTP headers, and help identify a session or user.

---

## Purpose of API Cookies

1. **Session Management:** Maintain authenticated sessions across requests
2. **Personalization:** Store user preferences
3. **Tracking & Analytics:** Monitor API usage
4. **Security:** Store tokens/flags to verify identity

## Types of Cookies

| Type                   | Description                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Session Cookies        | Temporary; deleted after session ends      |
| Persistent Cookies     | Stored long-term; survives browser closure |
| Tracking Cookies       | Track user behavior across sites/APIs      |
| Authentication Cookies | Maintain secure sessions                   |
| First-Party Cookies    | From the same domain/API                   |
| Third-Party Cookies    | From other domains (ads, analytics)        |

## How to Send API Cookies

Cookies are sent via the **`Cookie` HTTP header**:

```

Cookie: name=value; name2=value2

```

### Examples

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/data \
  -H "Cookie: session_token=abc123"
```

**Python (`requests`)**

```python
import requests

cookies = {'session_token': 'abc123'}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', cookies=cookies)
print(response.text)
```

**JavaScript (`fetch`)**

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
	method: "GET",
	credentials: "include", // send cookies with request
})
	.then((response) => response.json())
	.then((data) => console.log(data));
```

> Tools like **Apidog** or **Postman** allow easy management of API cookies.

## Best Practices for API Cookies

1. **Secure Sensitive Data:** Store tokens, not passwords
2. **Use HTTPS:** Protect cookies during transit
3. **Rotate Tokens Regularly:** Reduce risk if compromised
4. **Set Expiration:** Short-lived cookies for security
5. **HttpOnly & Secure Flags:** Prevent JS access and ensure HTTPS-only transmission
6. **Privacy Compliance:** Inform users and comply with GDPR/CCPA
7. **Regular Audits:** Review cookies for security and compliance

---

## Summary

-   API cookies are small data pieces for **authentication and session management**.
-   Sent via HTTP headers in requests and returned by servers.
-   Improve security, user experience, and simplify repeated API calls.
-   Follow best practices to ensure safety and compliance.
